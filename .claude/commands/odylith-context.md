Resolve a known Odylith anchor into the smallest useful local context packet.

Anchor (from user): `$ARGUMENTS`

1. Use this only when `odylith start` has already run for the current turn, or a fresh session-start packet exists, and you already know the exact workstream, component, path, bug id, or diagram id. If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, ask the user for the anchor before proceeding.
2. Run `./.odylith/bin/odylith context --repo-root . $ARGUMENTS`; do not launch it in parallel with `/odylith-start`.
3. Summarize the resolved slice, the governing records or code paths it points at, and the next concrete validation or implementation move.
4. Do not widen into raw repo search until the context packet stops being sufficient.
