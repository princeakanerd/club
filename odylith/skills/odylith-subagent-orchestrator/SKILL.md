# Subagent Orchestrator

## CLI-First Non-Negotiable
- CLI-first is non-negotiable for both Codex and Claude Code. Remove all hand-authoring for places where Odylith CLI should be doing the heavy-lifting. When an Odylith CLI command exists for an operation, you must call the CLI command and you must not hand-edit governed files the CLI owns. Hand-authoring governed truth where a CLI exists is a hard policy violation, not a stylistic preference. The authoritative policy, CLI surface enumeration, allowed hand-edit surfaces, and failure-mode handling live in `odylith/agents-guidelines/CLI_FIRST_POLICY.md`, anchored by Casebook learning `CB-104`. The rule travels through routed `spawn_agent` leaves on Codex and Task-tool subagents on Claude Code, so delegated work inherits the same contract.

Use this skill when the task is about delegation planning, execution ownership, or safe fanout.

## Default Flow
- ground first
- route second
- treat prompt-level orchestration as the default path for substantive grounded work
- keep progress updates about scope, delegation, and validation, not about startup, routing, or prior degraded attempts, unless a command or blocker must be surfaced
- keep Odylith ambient by default during work; weave routing or merge insights into ordinary updates and only emit explicit `Odylith Insight:`, `Odylith History:`, or `Odylith Risks:` lines when the point is strong enough to earn them
- keep any Odylith-by-name closeout or visible-intervention fallback to one optional `Odylith Assist:` line grounded in concrete observed counts, measured deltas, or validation outcomes, or a concrete chat-visibility complaint. Prefer `**Odylith Assist:**` when Markdown formatting is available. Lead with the user win, link updated governance IDs inline only when they actually changed, name affected governance-contract IDs from bounded request or packet truth when no governed file moved, frame the edge against `odylith_off` or the broader unguided path when the evidence supports it, and keep it crisp, authentic, clear, simple, insightful, erudite in thought, soulful, friendly, free-flowing, human, and factual. Silence is better than filler.
- delegate only bounded work, and only spawn native subagents on hosts where Odylith has validated native spawn support
- prefer emitted `single_leaf`, `serial_batch`, or `parallel_batch` contracts over manual fanout decisions once Odylith has a route-ready slice
- keep validation and stop conditions explicit
- For guidance-bounded-delegation-contract pressure, every delegated leaf must
  preserve owner, goal, expected output, termination condition, and validation
  expectation. If the route cannot make those fields concrete, stay local or
  narrow the slice before delegating.
- When guidance behavior proof is part of the task, include
  `./.odylith/bin/odylith validate guidance-behavior --repo-root .` or the
  case-scoped validator command in the validation expectation instead of
  relying on a generic "looks done" closeout.
- Both Codex and Claude Code are validated Odylith delegation hosts; Codex emits routed `spawn_agent` payloads subject to active host policy, while Claude Code executes the same bounded orchestration plan through Task-tool subagents and the checked-in `.claude/` project assets
