# Odylith Context Engine Operations

## CLI-First Non-Negotiable
- CLI-first is non-negotiable for both Codex and Claude Code. Remove all hand-authoring for places where Odylith CLI should be doing the heavy-lifting. When an Odylith CLI command exists for an operation, you must call the CLI command and you must not hand-edit governed files the CLI owns. Hand-authoring governed truth where a CLI exists is a hard policy violation, not a stylistic preference. The authoritative policy, CLI surface enumeration, allowed hand-edit surfaces, and failure-mode handling live in `odylith/agents-guidelines/CLI_FIRST_POLICY.md`, anchored by Casebook learning `CB-104`. The rule travels through routed `spawn_agent` leaves on Codex and Task-tool subagents on Claude Code, so delegated work inherits the same contract.

Use this skill when the task is about packet choice, daemon health, warmup posture, retrieval quality, or context-engine debugging.

## Lane Boundary
- Consumer lane uses Odylith's managed runtime for Odylith commands, but target
  repo validation still belongs to the consumer repo's own toolchain.
- Product-repo maintainer mode has:
  - pinned dogfood posture for shipped-runtime proof
  - detached `source-local` posture for live unreleased `src/odylith/*`
    execution
- File-edit authority follows repo scope, not interpreter choice.

## Default Flow
- check `status` or `doctor` first
- use `start` as the default first-turn entrypoint, then choose the smallest Odylith packet that matches the slice and stay on Odylith for most grounded work
- use `bootstrap`, `context`, `query`, `session-brief`, and `governance-slice` when you need grounded start-up, exact-ref lookup, or governed-surface context instead of rediscovering them manually
- keep consumer commentary task-first; keep startup, fallback, and retained-packet history implicit, and skip prior degraded-start history unless it remains the current blocker
- keep Odylith ambient by default during work; weave packet facts into ordinary updates and only emit explicit `Odylith Insight:`, `Odylith History:`, or `Odylith Risks:` lines when that signal is strong enough to matter
- if the final handoff benefits from naming Odylith, or when visible-intervention renders a prompt-submit or visibility-proof fallback, use at most one short `Odylith Assist:` line; prefer `**Odylith Assist:**` when Markdown formatting is available. Lead with the user win, link updated governance IDs inline only when they actually changed, name affected governance-contract IDs from bounded request or packet truth when no governed file moved, frame the edge against `odylith_off` or the broader unguided path when the evidence supports it, and back it with concrete observed counts, measured deltas, or validation outcomes, or a concrete chat-visibility complaint. Keep it crisp, authentic, clear, simple, insightful, erudite in thought, soulful, friendly, free-flowing, human, and factual. Silence is better than filler.
- keep widening fail-closed when `selection_state` is weak or `full_scan_recommended=true`
- preserve retained routing data when handing off to orchestration
- For Guidance Behavior slices, read the compact `guidance_behavior_summary`
  as packet availability evidence only. It may carry case ids, fingerprints,
  runtime-layer wiring, and validator commands across Context Engine,
  Execution Engine, Memory Contracts, intervention evidence, and Tribunal
  readouts, but the full validator still runs explicitly with
  `./.odylith/bin/odylith validate guidance-behavior --repo-root .`.
- reserve explicit `serve` for intentionally warm repeated loops
- Keep delivery-intelligence and shell refresh deterministic when the persisted Tribunal reasoning artifact is missing; explicit provider-backed reasoning belongs to dedicated reasoning and briefing flows, not the refresh hot path.
- When shared projection/compiler/backend reuse is in play, verify the
  provenance tuple and active derivation generation instead of trusting a warm
  cache by default.
- If reuse looks wrong, use `./.odylith/bin/odylith sync --repo-root . --debug-cache`
  and inspect the local debug manifest under
  `.odylith/cache/odylith-context-engine/` before widening further.

## Canonical Commands

```bash
./.odylith/bin/odylith start --repo-root .
./.odylith/bin/odylith context --repo-root . <exact-ref>
./.odylith/bin/odylith query --repo-root . "<text>"
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . status
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . doctor
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . impact <paths...>
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . architecture <paths...>
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . governance-slice --working-tree
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . session-brief --working-tree --working-tree-scope session --session-id <id> --claim-path <path>
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . benchmark --json
./.odylith/bin/odylith context-engine --repo-root . serve --watcher-backend auto
./.odylith/bin/odylith validate guidance-behavior --repo-root .
```

## Rules

- Use `query` only after concrete nouns, ids, or path tokens are already known.
- Read `retrieval_plan`, `guidance_brief`, `packet_quality`, `packet_metrics`, and `routing_handoff` literally before delegating from a packet.
- If `diagram_watch_gaps` or `full_scan_recommended` appears, use the packet's printed fallback command first and then read the named source directly before widening further.
