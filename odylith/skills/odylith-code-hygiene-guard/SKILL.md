# Odylith Code Hygiene Guard

Use this skill when a slice shows duplicate helper churn, fake modularization,
oversized-file pressure, mirrored host drift, or comment slop. Treat AI slop
as a regression.

This skill is shared across consumer and maintainer lanes, and it applies on
both Codex and Claude. Codex and Claude must enforce the same anti-slop
contract across consumer and maintainer lanes. Consumer repos may be Python,
TypeScript, JavaScript, Go, Rust, Java, shell, SQL, or mixed-language; the
language changes, the anti-slop bar does not.
Apply that bar to any codebase or project surface: services, libraries, apps,
CLIs, infra glue, scripts, docs, prompts, hooks, templates, config, and
generated assets all count.
Structural cleanup is not permission to drift behavior, UX, or UI. Preserve
semantics deliberately and prove the touched contract on the real toolchain or
surface that owns it.

No transitional states. Do not replace one slop class with another. Move
ownership, not just file boundaries.

## Default Flow
- Read the nearest `AGENTS.md`, then read
  `odylith/agents-guidelines/ANTI_SLOP_AND_DECOMPOSITION.md` before editing.
- Inventory the current owner, call sites, shared helpers, validators, and
  file sizes before changing structure.
- Inventory the bounded slop signals explicitly before editing:
  remaining `def _host()` shims, `bind(host)` / `_HOST_BIND_NAMES` globals
  injection, duplicate `_mapping` or `_normalize_*` helpers, near-identical
  host mirrors, local alias walls that hide the real owner, phase-mixed giant
  functions, and touched files already above the repo size thresholds.
- Treat the slop class, not the language syntax, as the thing to ban.
- Inventory the equivalent non-Python slop signals explicitly before editing:
  duplicated parser or normalizer helpers, near-identical adapters or hook
  scripts, phase-mixed controllers or components, mirrored prompt or config
  assets, and extracted modules that still tunnel back into parent internals.
- Inventory lane and host reach as well before editing: shared guidance,
  install-generated guidance, Codex assets, Claude assets, shared skills, and
  shipped mirrors that must stay aligned if the rule changes.
- Inventory project-surface reach too before editing: source files, hooks,
  prompts, templates, config, docs, generators, and installed assets that may
  be carrying the same slop class under different file extensions.
- Consolidate generic coercion and normalization helpers into a real shared
  owner instead of adding one more local wrapper.
- Do not treat a shared helper or kernel as a cleanup ornament. If it lands,
  adopt it in the touched slice or leave a bounded follow-up tied to the same
  slop class.
- Do not hide the old owner behind compatibility wrappers, lazy proxies,
  facade accessors, or mirror-only indirection after a nominal extraction.
- Partial shared-kernel adoption is still incomplete. If a shared helper or
  kernel lands, the touched callers must adopt it or the pass is incomplete.
- If a touched hand-maintained source file is already above `1200` LOC,
  choose decomposition or carry an explicit active decomposition plan before
  adding more growth.
- If a touched function is already above `500` LOC, extract at least one real
  phase owner or data-model seam in the same pass unless the change is purely
  a safety-critical repair.
- Remove the slop class end to end inside the touched slice. Do not stop at a
  halfway state where the shared owner exists but the touched duplicates still
  remain.
- Do not call the pass complete just because the first smell disappeared. If
  the replacement smell still exists in the touched slice, the pass is
  incomplete.
- Update inline documentation only for invariants, failure modes, boundary
  assumptions, or non-obvious state transitions.
- Add or update enforcement tests so the cleanup stays pinned in CI.

## Hard Bans
- `def _host()` plus a wall of rebound private host symbols is banned.
- `bind(host)`, `_HOST_BIND_NAMES`, or `bind_*_runtime(globals(), host)` are
  banned when they still hide the real dependency owner behind globals
  injection.
- A local alias wall that only renames dozens of helpers without moving the
  ownership boundary is banned.
- Do not duplicate generic coercion helpers such as `_mapping`,
  `_json_dict`, `_normalize_*`, `_delta`, or `_parts` across files when one
  shared owner is appropriate.
- Do not allow the same failure class to hide behind non-Python syntax:
  duplicated parser helpers, cloned adapters, giant mixed-phase handlers,
  mirrored hook scripts, or boilerplate config and template assets are the
  same regression under a different file extension.
- Do not hide the same slop class behind host-only hooks, prompt formatters,
  command shims, statuslines, or generated guidance assets.
- Do not leave giant renderers, payload builders, or routers phase-mixed when
  the touched slice can be split into data prep, view model, and
  template/render stages, or gather, score, and decide stages.
- Do not keep host-mirror files near-identical when a shared helper, shared
  renderer, or shared formatter would remove the duplication.
- Do not add filler comments or docstrings.
- New or materially rewritten runtime Python modules must carry a truthful
  module docstring.

## Required Proof
- Every anti-slop cleanup must add or update enforcement tests.
- For shared hot paths, user-visible flows, or high-risk structural moves,
  land characterization or contract-focused tests before or alongside the
  refactor instead of relying on post hoc confidence.
- Run the focused regression suite for the touched slice.
- When the user asks for repo-wide or lane-wide anti-slop hardening, update
  guidance, skills, install-generated guidance, host contracts, mirrors, and
  enforcement tests together; prose-only hardening is incomplete.
- In consumer repos, run the consumer repo's own toolchain, tests, lints,
  type checks, and build validation for the touched stack after Odylith
  narrows the slice.
- When the anti-slop rule itself changes, update shared guidance, host
  contracts, install-generated guidance, skills, and shipped mirrors in the
  same pass.
- If the change updates guidance, skills, or shipped mirrors, validate the
  source and bundle copies in the same change.
- If the pass claims repo-wide or lane-wide cleanup, rerun the requested
  repo-wide structural scan or equivalent inventory before closeout.
- Repo-wide or lane-wide anti-slop claims require two proof layers: fresh
  behavior proof for the touched slice and a fresh structural inventory for
  the claimed scope. One does not substitute for the other.
- Guidance-only hardening without updated tests, validators, or mirror-content
  checks is incomplete.
- If the change touches shared runtime hot paths, run the full runtime suite.
- If the change touches browser-proved surfaces, run the full headless browser
  matrix.
- When browser proof applies, cover the real rendered states that own the
  contract: normal, empty/fallback, and degraded or error states when they
  exist.
- If the change touches install, upgrade, repair, launchers, or install-managed
  mirror surfaces, run the install suite and the mirror-content checks.

## Fail-Closed Exit Criteria
- No touched file may still contain `def _host()` or `host = _host()` after
  the cleanup.
- No touched file may keep a newly avoidable `_mapping`, `_normalize_*`,
  `_delta`, or `_parts` clone once the shared owner exists.
- No touched pass may leave a shared helper or kernel as an ornament while the
  touched callers stay on local forks without a bounded follow-up.
- No touched non-Python file may keep the same duplicated parser, adapter,
  prompt, config, or hook pattern once the shared owner exists.
- No touched giant function may exit with the same phase-mixed ownership it had
  on entry when the pass is explicitly about structural debt.
- No touched file may replace a removed shim with a new alias wall that still
  hides the owner behind rebinding.
- Do not close the pass on assumption. Fail closed until the proof lane for
  the touched install, runtime, and browser surfaces is green.
