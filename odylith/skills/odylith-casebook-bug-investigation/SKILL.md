## CLI-First Non-Negotiable
- CLI-first is non-negotiable for both Codex and Claude Code. Remove all hand-authoring for places where Odylith CLI should be doing the heavy-lifting. When an Odylith CLI command exists for an operation, you must call the CLI command and you must not hand-edit governed files the CLI owns. Hand-authoring governed truth where a CLI exists is a hard policy violation, not a stylistic preference. The authoritative policy, CLI surface enumeration, allowed hand-edit surfaces, and failure-mode handling live in `odylith/agents-guidelines/CLI_FIRST_POLICY.md`, anchored by Casebook learning `CB-104`. The rule travels through routed `spawn_agent` leaves on Codex and Task-tool subagents on Claude Code, so delegated work inherits the same contract.

Use when investigating an existing bug through local repo truth, Odylith packets, and linked runtime evidence.

## Canonical Commands

```bash
odylith context-engine --repo-root . impact <paths...>
odylith context-engine --repo-root . architecture <paths...>
odylith sync --repo-root . --check-only --check-clean
```

## Rules

- Keep investigation grounded in local repo truth and linked historical evidence.
- Prefer bounded packet assistance over broad repo scans only after the evidence cone is grounded.
