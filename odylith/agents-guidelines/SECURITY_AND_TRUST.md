# Security And Trust

## CLI-First Non-Negotiable
- CLI-first is non-negotiable for both Codex and Claude Code. Remove all hand-authoring for places where Odylith CLI should be doing the heavy-lifting. When an Odylith CLI command exists for an operation, you must call the CLI command and you must not hand-edit governed files the CLI owns. Hand-authoring governed truth where a CLI exists is a hard policy violation, not a stylistic preference. The authoritative policy, CLI surface enumeration, allowed hand-edit surfaces, and failure-mode handling live in `odylith/agents-guidelines/CLI_FIRST_POLICY.md`, anchored by Casebook learning `CB-104`. The rule travels through routed `spawn_agent` leaves on Codex and Task-tool subagents on Claude Code, so delegated work inherits the same contract.

## Security Boundary
- Treat the repo launcher, the managed runtime, the repo-root trust anchor,
  and the signed release asset path as one connected trust boundary.
- Fail closed when runtime trust is ambiguous. Do not widen into host Python
  or insecure local asset overrides just to keep work moving.
- `source-local` is an explicit maintainer development posture, not a
  tamper-proof or release-eligible runtime.

## Lane Rules
- Consumer lane:
  - use only the verified managed runtime behind `./.odylith/bin/odylith`
  - reject `ODYLITH_RELEASE_BASE_URL`,
    `ODYLITH_RELEASE_ALLOW_INSECURE_LOCALHOST`, and
    `ODYLITH_RELEASE_SKIP_SIGSTORE_VERIFY`
  - treat `.odylith/trust/managed-runtime-trust/` as the gitignored
    local trust anchor for managed-runtime integrity
  - allow legacy `0.1.0` and `0.1.1` compatibility only long enough to
    bootstrap onto a newer trusted release
- Pinned dogfood:
  - same trust expectations as consumer lane
  - use this posture for shipped-runtime proof
- Detached `source-local`:
  - validate wrapper and source-root integrity
  - do not describe this posture as immutable or release-grade

## Runtime Integrity Rules
- The launcher must only execute trusted managed runtimes or validated
  maintainer wrappers.
- Legacy `0.1.0` and `0.1.1` managed runtimes are compatibility exceptions,
  not full-trust peers; prefer repairing or upgrading away from them.
- Managed-runtime trust must live outside `.odylith/` so runtime-only tamper
  cannot rewrite its own proof.
- Hot-path verification happens before `odylith.cli` import; deeper tree
  verification belongs in doctor, repair, and same-version runtime reuse.
- Feature packs only attach to already trusted managed runtimes.

## Supply-Chain Rules
- Release assets must come from trusted hosts and verify against the expected
  Sigstore signer identity plus OIDC issuer.
- Canonical workflows should pin first-party GitHub Actions to immutable SHAs,
  pin the runner image, and avoid floating maintainer tooling installs.
- Local hosted-release overrides are product-repo rehearsal tools and must
  stay unavailable in consumer posture.

## Process-Lifetime Rules
- Treat unexpected long-lived Odylith Python helpers as bugs until proven
  otherwise.
- Startup, daemon readiness, timed-out child process groups, and worker
  shutdown should all fail closed.
- After runtime or daemon changes, explicitly verify that Odylith-owned Python
  processes exit when the command or timeout path is complete.

## Consumer Greenfield Rules
- Greenfield Domain Intelligence may reason from user intent, but it must keep
  observed source, user intent, and Odylith assumptions separate.
- `odylith greenfield apply` must remain confirmation-gated and must reject
  missing host-authored Atlas Mermaid source, duplicated topology, invalid
  evidence tiers, and incomplete proposal sections before any governed write.
- Host routes may help the operator draft a proposal, but Codex, Claude Code,
  and future hosts must not own the durable validation or write boundary.

## Host Configuration Rules
- Managed Codex and Claude assets must merge additively with user-owned host
  settings.
- Do not replace user host configuration with Odylith-only templates.
- Release prep must prove host merge safety for any changed managed hook,
  skill, command, or settings asset before GA.

## Projection Reuse Trust Rules
- Shared projection/compiler/backend substrates are trusted only when their
  persisted provenance still matches the current repo root, scope, fingerprint,
  code version, and active derivation generation when a sync session is live.
- Fail closed on provenance mismatch. Do not widen the trust boundary by
  accepting stale manifests, partial tables, or fingerprint-only matches when
  generation or code-version evidence disagrees.
- Keep compiler/backend writes single-writer and atomic. Latency work may batch
  locking, but it must not weaken the advisory-lock plus atomic-replace
  contract that prevents torn or interleaved local state.

## Release Prep Rules
- Release-facing security docs, public docs, browser surfaces, and
  install-managed assets must be covered by `odylith release migration-gate`
  for the target version before GA.
- Reuse accepted candidate proof for the same artifact instead of rerunning
  expensive full-suite or consumer rehearsal gates without new evidence.
